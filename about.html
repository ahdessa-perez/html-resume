    <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I was hooked. 
        The ability to create something tangible out of a few keystrokes is nothing short of magical. 
        Web development, to me, is more than just coding; it's about crafting immersive experiences that leave a lasting impact.

        <li>Collaborative Spirit: Web development is a team effort, and I thrive in collaborative environments. I believe that the best solutions emerge from diverse perspectives working together.</li>
        <li>Continuous Learner: The tech world evolves rapidly, and I'm committed to staying at the forefront. Whether it's mastering a new framework or exploring the latest industry trends, I'm always eager to learn.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Throughout my academic journey, I've dived into projects like Online Portfolio, where I had the chance 
        to designed and developed a personal portfolio website showcasing projects, skills, and experiences.
        These experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but also honed my ability to work efficiently in a team.
